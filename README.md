# **Bank Account Management System**

## **Scenario**

I developed a simplified system in Java that allows customers to manage their accounts efficiently. The application offers multiple types of accounts, each with different rules for transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and overdrafts. Additionally, customers should be able to view their transaction history to track their spending.

To achieve this, the bank needs a structured and well-designed system that ensures smooth account management while maintaining flexibility for future upgrades. The goal of this project is to build a basic banking system that can handle different account types, process transactions securely, and maintain a clear history of all customer transactions.

## **Account Types**

1. **Savings Account**
    - Allows deposits and withdrawals
    - Does **not** permit overdrafts
    - Maintains a minimum balance requirement

2. **Current Account**
    - Designed for frequent transactions
    - Allows overdrafts up to a certain limit

3. **Fixed Deposit Account**
    - Customers deposit a fixed amount
    - Amount **cannot** be withdrawn until a maturity date
    - Offers higher interest rates

## **Objectives**

- Demonstrate key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Abstract Classes
    - Interfaces
- Use **linked lists** to track transaction history efficiently
- Ensure a modular and extensible system for future upgrades
